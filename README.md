# German-Tank-Problem

[The German Tank Problem](https://www.albert.io/blog/german-tank-problem-explained-ap-statistics-review/) is a famous example of statistical estimation used during World War II by Allied forces to estimate the production of German military vehicles, particularly tanks. The problem illustrates how statistical methods can be used to make accurate predictions based on limited data.

Allied forces would capture enemy tanks and note their serial numbers during the war. Since each tank was stamped with a serial number in sequence, these numbers provided crucial information about the total number of tanks produced. However, only a small sample of serial numbers would be available, and the challenge was to estimate the total production from this sample.
